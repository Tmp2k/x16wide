  ## Roadmap
  
  ### Done: Gauge interest / select features
  See who's on board and what the community want's from this project. If you're interested in working on this please drop me an email on steven@nemiah.uk. Anyone with experience with emscripten would be a huge bonus!
  
  ### Done: Build BASIC only version without compilers
  Build a version that just allows people to code in BASIC but includes examples and demos and allows people to share their own code with a single click.
  
  ### Now: add the ability to load .prg 
  
  ### Then: add assemblers/compilers and support for ASM, C etc
  
  ### Then: add multiple tabs/files and code editor features
  
  ### Way down the road: add sprite editors and other utils
